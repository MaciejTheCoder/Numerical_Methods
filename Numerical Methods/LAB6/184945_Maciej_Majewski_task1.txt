"Your first task is to determine the function which approximates the drone position. Is
it better to use interpolation or approximation?"

In my opinion it's better to use approximation, because interpolation is to simple for this kind of data. Approximation will better and more accurate.
I would use interpolation to 2 dimension datas (x,y).
